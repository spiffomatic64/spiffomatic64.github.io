<br>Telesto<br>PUBLIC KEY 053 689 DWS REGAL - FROM: PLDN KAMALA RIOR [PLDN CMD TF 5.3] - TO: ACT RGNT PETRA VENJ - SUBJECT: PRISON OF ELDERS – CONTAINMENT RISK -  - MESSAGE IS: -  - 1. Contingency reserves overdrawn. We underestimated nobility troth reparations. Uldren suggests that we open reintegration talks. Have you discussed endowment support? -  - 2. If Reef endorses support, Paladin Oran will engineer reinforcement. -  - MESSAGE ENDS<br>Vestiges of the Queen's Harbingers yet linger among Saturn's moons.<br>
<br>Perfect Paradox<br>I never found Osiris, but I've killed enough Vex to end a war. And they, in turn, struck a fatal blow: they completed a Mind with the sole function to drain the Light from me. It worked very well. -  - Don't worry (not that you worry much). It took them centuries to build, keyed to the unique frequency of my Light. And I sit atop its shattered husk. -  - I mourn that I will never reach the heights you have. To me, you represent everything a Guardian can become. Yours is a thriving City. So different from mine. My whole fourteenth life I fought to make my City yours. I never finished. -  - All I have left is this weapon. The Cryptarchs say you crafted it yourself, built it out of scraps and Light and sheer will, inside the Infinite Forge. I'll make sure it finds its way back to you. When you gave it to me, I swore I would make it my duty to follow your example. -  - I'm still trying. -  - —Saint-14<br>A tale that's different from the rest: the thread unfurls against the clocks. - The one the Speaker loved the best must have a perfect paradox.<br>
<br>Kairos Function<br>Compartmentalization. Isolate the pieces of a network, so that 1) each subnet may operate independently, and 2) any harm that befalls one subnet will not necessarily befall the rest. The Vex learned this lesson well. Many subnets, many equations, all executing toward the same answer: convergence. They gambled that eventually, one of their subnets will achieve it. Speaking in purely mathematical terms, it's a very safe bet. -  - In that conceptual framework, you see how the Forest, “infinite” in so many ways, is still only a small fraction of the Vex's true capabilities. Imagine the decimal two-point-one repeating. Its precise value is incalculably infinite, and yet you know that beyond its irrational depths waits two-point-two. Two-point three. Two-point-four…<br>'Some speculate that the radiolarian fluid is the last vestige of a biological life form that became the Vex.' —Sister Faora, 'Theories on the Vex'<br>
<br>Traitor's Fate<br>Know that I am Calus, the last and greatest emperor of the Cabal. Know that the Ghost Primus was false and that your place in my court was secured when he met the Traitor's Fate. Finally, my champion, little else stands between us. -  - Look to the heavens and you will see me with my arms spread wide. Fly to me and I will bathe you in gold, share the fruits of my gardens, and watch you grow dizzy on libations. -  - Know that my heart swells with love. I yearn to find those who can accept my gifts, who can take my hand, and share in my mirth. -  - Together we shall rebuild an empire.<br>Let the emperor's gratitude end your foes as swiftly as you have ended his.<br>
<br>Peace by Consensus<br>Consensus Meeting 3230.01 - Zavala: 'I call this meeting of the Consensus to order.” - New Monarchy: 'Only the Speaker can call us to order.' - Cayde-6: 'Oh, really? Well, guess we can't have meetings anymore. If you'll excuse me—' - Ikora Rey: “Sit down, Cayde. We're having this discussion, bylaws be damned.” - FWC: 'What do the bylaws say about choosing a new Speaker?” - Z: “Nothing.” - IR: “Then we'll write new ones.” - DO: “Knowing us, that's going to take time. A lot of time.” - Z: “In the meanwhile, we will have to move forward without a Speaker.” - NM: “Who will take his place? You?” - Z: “None of us will take the Speaker's place. And all of us will. We must find our own consensus now.”<br>'The Consensus is bigger than the Speaker. Bigger than any of us. It will survive, because it has to.' —Commander Zavala, acting head of the Consensus<br>
<br>The Stag<br>In a distant life I knew fear. But bones cannot bleed. Your slings and arrows carve runes of power into my skull. I am prey no longer. -  - I was your sacrifice. Your food, your harvest. You thought I would lie where I fell. But I am prey no longer. -  - Now it is my turn to stalk you among the long shadows. To make your strength my own. To take all you hold dear. -  - For I am prey no longer.<br>Only bones for your feast. Only death for my victory.<br>
<br>Curse of Foresight<br>Consensus Meeting 2891.98 -  - NM: 'I note for the record that we are without a Warlock Vanguard or a Vanguard Commander.' - Andal Brask: 'Two birds, one man.' - Zavala: 'Ikora Rey is interim Warlock Vanguard for this meeting.' - Speaker: “Which brings us to our first order of business. Ikora Rey, the Consensus formally requests you assume the responsibilities of Warlock Vanguard.” - Ikora Rey: 'Considering I've been performing those responsibilities for a while now, I accept.' - FWC: 'Why did you cover for him for so long?' - IR: 'Someone had to do it.' - S: 'Ahem. Now that we have Consensus, I may inform you I have decided to banish former Warlock Vanguard Osiris from the Last City.' - [murmurs] - S: 'Are there any objections?” - DO: 'None here. Maybe he'll find a better planet for us.' - [pause] - S: 'Very well. Next: I name Titan Vanguard Zavala as the new Vanguard Commander. Congratulations.'<br>'But will my actions avert the futures I see, or cause them?' —Osiris<br>
<br>SV-112 Predator<br>Comms Transmission -  - 1: Manse-5, what's your status? - 2: Three Pikes on my tail coming into the Gulch. No biggie. - 1: Roger that. How's the new Sparrow handling? Heard Amanda's been tinkering with it herself. - 2: Hold that thought. [crackle] [hum of thrusters] [snapping branches] - 1: Come in, Manse! - 2: Engine's got a bit of a kick there! Pulling up sharp on the curve and— [roar] Boosting! - 1: We're near the Firebase, but we can head back. - 2: Woohoo— [explosion] - 1: Manse! - 2: Did a little barrel roll there! Got two Pikes… Uh-oh. Cabal. - 1: It's no big deal to come back for you. - 2: Big ship. Big. Heading right for it. - 1: Uh, go around it. - 2: [sustained thrumming] - 1: Manse. - 2: [thrumming] [explosion] - 1: Manse! - 2: No more baddies! Just wheeeeling into the bend now. - 1: Can you not do that again, please? - 2: Buying Amanda a drink tonight!<br>And watch out—it's hungry.<br>
<br>Concentric Dawn<br>PRAISE FOR IKORA REY'S 'ON CIRCLES: REVISED EDITION': -  - 'In volume after volume, Ikora Rey pioneers devastating new ways for Warlocks to destroy our enemies.' —Vanguard Commander Zavala -  - 'A monumental scholarly achievement that deserves a place in any serious library.' —Tyra Karn -  - 'An inspiring work that challenges conventions of metaphysics and ontology through the prism of a deceptively simple shape: the circle. Impressive!' —Lord Shaxx -  - 'Despite a lack of rigorous data analysis and an overreliance on the mystical, this book has merits that even I must acknowledge.' —Asher Mir -  - 'Based on the couple of pages I got through, this is one of Ikora's most well-rounded works yet, although she makes kind of a circular argument. Also, the paper's really high quality. Very soft and smooth.' —Cayde-6<br>'Study the sacred geometry of light and life.' —Ikora Rey<br>
<br>Null Calamity 9<br>'I've misplaced Osiris again,' Sagira told a Goblin. -  - The Goblin, being a Goblin, shot at her. -  - She dodged with a sigh, and continued through the Forest. -  - 'If I was Osiris, where would I go to celebrate Panoptes becoming scrap metal?' -  - The answer, when Sagira finally tracked him down, surprised her. -  - Osiris hovered, cross-legged, at the center of a ruined Lighthouse. A dead sun loomed in the lightless sky. Arrayed on the ground below to the horizon, yellow Vex eyes pierced the gloom.  -  - Sagira zoomed straight to Osiris's side. 'I thought we averted this future!” -  - Eyes closed, Osiris shook his head. “Many equations lead to this answer.” -  - A sound like a drumbeat, but with the impact of an earthquake, shook the Lighthouse. -  - Sagira darted through the crumbling chamber. 'What do we do?' -  - Another bone-rattling drumbeat kicked up clouds of dust. -  - Osiris floated to his feet. 'We start over.' -  - BOOM. Through the window, a shadow eclipsed the Vex eyes.  -  - 'But first,' he said. 'You'll have to rez me again, old friend.'<br>A sacred eye that speaks in lies—upending futures in its path. - The way before us to the skies shall see itself in ancient wrath.<br>
<br>Jack Queen King 3<br>From the journals of Ikora Rey -  - When I studied with Osiris, he would often tell me: “I see failure in your future.” No matter how hard I worked, no matter how strong I became, always: “I still see failure.” -  - I think now what he saw was Io. -  - When I lost my Light and retreated from a ruined City, when I arrived on Io to find only silence, I too thought I had failed. Even after Ghaul's defeat and the Traveler's waking, I told my friends I thought the Traveler had tested me, and that I had failed its test. -  - But now I'm not so sure. -  - Perhaps what Osiris saw for me—what I experienced on Io—was simply that I needed help. That most human of conditions. I needed to be in a fireteam, and to be a fireteam for others in turn. -  - How like Osiris to see that and name it failure. -  - I won't make that mistake again.<br>An army meets, and stands, and falls. Three nobles wage their hopeless war. - In shifting madness, evil crawls. One stands above the battle's roar.<br>
<br>West of Sunfall 7<br>Excerpt of a letter from Ikora Rey to Eris Morn: -  - Would it be terribly offensive if I said I would have happily traded places with you and gone down to the Hellmouth rather than be in the City during Osiris's banishment? -  - Well, here's what you missed. It started because of his Lost Prophecies. A misnomer—the prophecies were always accessible to those who cared about them, but the Followers proclaimed them “lost” to a City that had censored all Osirian material. And even then the City didn't truly lose them, for when the Speaker ordered me to destroy Osiris's writings, I placed the documents in my private library instead. I don't believe in burning books, regardless of my opinion of the author. -  - As to why he had to write the prophecies in iambic couplets? Simple: vanity.<br>A spark of knowledge with each fall, the purpose of the endless youth. - No longer shunned, dark's nameless call now brings about tenebrous truth.<br>
<br>Crimson<br>'This is crazy! You don't need this thing. I can heal you; that's my whole job.' - 'I thought your job was to state the obvious.' - 'What?' - 'Oh, come on. Ever since you found me, it's been, 'Watch out, Fallen ahead!' when they're right in front of me. Or, my favorite: 'Seems like the door's locked.' Is it? Really? I couldn't tell. And when it's not that, you say I need to be more self-sufficient in case we lose the Light again. So here's my answer. Here's the remedy.' - 'I was just trying to help.'<br>According to official Vanguard policy, this weapon does not exist.<br>
<br>Kairos Function<br>Physically, I am beneath the surface of Mercury. That is what Sagira's sensors say. The Vex hollowed out the planet, replaced its molten heart with cold right angles. -  - But that is not what I see. -  - I see infinity. -  - An infinity of possible worlds, so perfectly simulated as to be indistinguishable from the experiences I once called “reality.” I can touch them, taste them, pass lifetimes in them! They grow within this machine like fruit upon a tree—no, a forest of trees, its fractal expansion nigh unmeasurable. -  - I said that to Sagira and she replied, “Sounds like a challenge.” -  - This Ghost of mine knows me too well. -  - It strikes me now that I could find in this Infinite Forest a reality in which Ikora accompanied me into its endless mysteries. -  - What an awful, destructive machine this is. -  - I must know everything about it.<br>'Some speculate that the radiolarian fluid is the last vestige of a biological life form that became the Vex.' —Sister Faora, 'Theories on the Vex'<br>
<br>The Jade Rabbit<br>Do you ever wonder who you were before you were resurrected? Do you experience debilitating anxiety when you think about the cold, crushing fist of death? Has the desire to lie face-down on the floor for hours at a time been holding YOU back? -  - From the people that brought you Lunal comes prescription-strength Immortalia: a revolutionary new combat elixir shown to relieve the crippling existential crises of your second life. Immortalia can reduce symptoms of listlessness, cynicism, and social anxiety. Side effects may include dancing, salty behavior, and acts of group heroism. -  - Do not take Immortalia while operating all-terrain thrust bikes.<br>'What kind of harebrained scheme have you got in mind this time?'<br>
<br>The Colony<br>Have you ever watched a snake kill something? It's awful. It's so awful. I watched a man die of a terciopelo bite once. Out by the northern wall. I still have nightmares about it. -  - Anyway, that's where VEIST comes from. The inspiration, I mean. Weapons with all the power of a venomous creature. Plus an onboard AI with that creature's killer instincts. -  - And now there's the Colony. A  -  launcher packed with fully mobile, AI-controlled insectoid detonators, each one designed with a taste for blood. -  - We've made some pretty messed-up stuff. You've probably seen it. You know. But we've never made anything like the Colony before.<br>We outnumber you. We will find you. You are alone, and we are colony.<br>

<br>Graviton Forfeit<br>Just sit down and think about what you're doing. -  - A big white ball rebuilt you from nothing. Guided your civilization. Transformed you. Didn't tell you why, did it? Doubt it mentioned the omnipotent space anathema that's coming to kill you and your dog and your whole soccer club, either, but what's a little xenocide between friends? -  - Maybe you don't care. A gun never stops and wonders if things are more complicated. It just shoots. -  - It's also possible that I'm just trying to get inside your head. You're a hero with a cape and a gun and a bike. You're gonna live forever. Who's got time for doubt? Fight the 'Darkness'! Yeah! -  - You know what I'd call 'dark,' in the sense of 'grim,' in the sense of 'cosmically upsetting'? A universe full of weaponized puppets, enacting a genocidal war against the servants of a rival god. -  - Is this making you uncomfortable? I'm sorry. I'll be more evil. Boo. Grrr.<br>'Doesn't matter how good you are; you stay out there too long, you're not coming back. Not the same way you left, anyway.' —Tevis<br>
<br>Sol Pariah 6<br>Osiris stood at the far end of the Underwatch, his back to her. -  - 'We need to talk,' she said. -  - Sagira turned. He did not. -  - 'I'm surprised you came alone. Have you finally learned confidence?' -  - 'Yes.' Ikora clenched her fists, then released them. 'Not from you.' -  - He crossed his hands behind his back. 'I know why you're here.' -  - 'I should hope so.' -  - 'This meeting was prophesied. As is my impending banishment.' -  - 'Then you had ample warning.' -  - 'This is ridiculous!' Sagira snapped. 'We're at war. Osiris does what you all are too scared to do, and you banish him? How're you gonna win against the Darkness without him?” -  - Osiris held up a hand to silence her. -  - 'Ikora knows,' he said. 'She pretends otherwise, but she knows.' -  - 'Winning by your terms is no victory.' Ikora's hands were fists again. She unclenched them. 'Goodbye, Osiris.'<br>Amid the endless death one flew—unnatural all-consuming need— - And in the space between the two, accursed comprehension freed.<br>
<br>The Conqueror 2<br>Excerpt from a letter written by Lord Shaxx to the Speaker, dated three years ago: -  - I do not appreciate wasting time that should be spent forging Guardians into their best selves. But since you have seen fit to launch a formal investigation into my beliefs, I will explain them as simply as I can for you. -  - I am no 'follower' of anything. I believe thanatology is just an excuse for insomnia and that Ahamkaras are for cheaters. I find the Acataleptic belief that Darkness is incomprehensible to be pessimistic nihilism, and its opposite—the Osirian position that Darkness must be understood—to be misanthropic narcissism. -  - But I will also take good ideas where I can get them. And Osiris's belief that Guardian minds and bodies can be sharpened as one sharpens a sword is a damn good idea. You've seen the results in the Crucible. Do I really have to say any more?<br>To Tower comes a war in red; an orphan sounds the empire's call. - Mortal angels mourn the dead while lightless light wraps night in pall.<br>

<br>Prometheus Lens<br>How's it work? Ha! The underlying principles are quite simple, really. The gun's pyreliophorite crystal— -  - Pyreliophorite? It's an Ionian crystal which bears some resemblance to rudimentary perovskite, which is, as you should know, a crystal with unique photovoltaic properties— -  - Photovoltaic? It means 'regarding the conversion of light into electricity.' -  - No, no, the gun doesn't create electricity; the gun induces an external combustion reaction. It's perovskite that— -  - I just explained the perovskite! If you'd stop interrupting— -  - Wait. I remember you. You're one of Cayde's Hunters! Get out of here! Shoo! The Cryptarchy wants nothing to do with you!<br>'Cryptarchs made a crystal that starts fires? Get me one. I don't care how you do it. Go!' —Cayde-6<br>
<br>Ophidian Aspect<br>A torn and crumpled journal page, found on the street in the City: -  - —not his lessons I remember so much as the words we exchanged in passing. I recall a trivial argument we had over some tale from the Golden Age. It might have been a love story, or a tragedy. -  - A proud queen, forsaken by a lover obsessed with his past heroism, chooses to preserve her dignity in death rather than endure humiliation. -  - He brought it up as an example of why we should not fear death, but even as he spoke, I thought to myself: what about those who looked to her to rule? Those whose lives depended on her own? -  - Now, looking back, it strikes me that he talked with the arrogance of one who can always return from the Void. One who has contemplated the darkness so long he thinks of it as a friend, of sorts.<br>'Have I the aspic in my lips?'<br>
<br>Machina Dei 4<br>From the writings of Brother Vance: -  - To be a Guardian! How I longed for it. After a near-death experience in which I lost my eyesight, I even believed that I had become a Guardian, that the great Osiris had granted me my dearest wish. -  - How young and foolish I was! -  - But now that I am thirty, and wise, I know better. I wanted to be a Guardian, but what I needed was to feel like I was enough. Like I was equal to the great task of life. That I was heroic. -  - And THAT, my friends, is the beauty of Osiris's teachings! That if you work, if you strive, if you suffer for the sake of improvement, you CAN become better! -  - It's a hard life I've chosen, full of sweat and pain and darkness. But I have never been so free!<br>A charnel but effulgent orb—beacon in a loathsome dark— - Fêted, fetid corpses rise—a too-long-absent gibbous spark.<br>
<br>Infinite Paths 8<br>From the writings of Brother Vance: -  - Anyone can see the signs if they just truly look!  Osiris preserve us, I am blind and I recognized the signs of his lost prophecies coming to bear! -  - But none of us—not even his most faithful—have seen the things Osiris has seen. -  - We in the Lighthouse follow a man haunted by visions of apocalypse, yet doesn't turn away. Osiris doesn't close his eyes. He doesn't even blink. He put aside his Vanguard duties, his students, his very life, to bear this curse. And why? Because it is the only way to become strong enough to save you from the enemy. -  - You in the City who condemned Osiris, who cast him out and cursed his name, do you not understand that the prophecies are curse enough?<br>They sowed the First, now reap the Last; forever narrows to a line - Where Light will fade into the past; when all's converted, nothing shines.<br>
<br>Sails of Osiris<br>Ikora walked into the hangar and found Osiris inspecting his ship's engine. She put her hand on a turbine and steadied her breathing. -  - 'Make sure Shipwright Hiponia does a diagnostic check before you leave for Mercury,' she said to her old mentor. 'Cesar is very thorough.' -  - Osiris smiled wryly. 'You're always one step ahead of everyone else. It's what makes you a leader among all Warlocks.' -  - 'Then you understand why I must remain; to continue to lead as you once led.' -  - 'Thousands of Vex simulations can help us understand the Darkness, Ikora!' Osiris said. 'This could be the key to—' -  - 'Osiris,' Ikora interrupted. 'I wish you well on your mission, but I fear that your obsession will be your undoing.' -  - “Obsession?!” -  - “We have each made a choice. I choose to stay and fight what is real.”<br>'When eyes are clear, justice need not be blind.' —Fractal Scrolls<br>
<br>Saint-14's Gray Pigeon<br>Ship's Final Log: -  - Osiris. -  - I hope whatever you find in this place is worth it. My recommendation to install you as Vanguard Commander was not a gesture to stroke your ego. It was an order to stay and help the City achieve all that it could. An order you refused to follow. News of my demise will no doubt reach you late. I can already see your response—the guilt that will follow, however fleeting. I thought you had changed after Six Fronts; that seeing your people on the brink of destruction and spared from death would be reward enough to stay. To fight. I'll fight in your stead one last time. -  - Father. -  - My duty is at its end. I've seen what the City can become. I know you can lead its people to it. -  - To my inspiration. -  - Your final gift to me I now send back to you. It will be good to see you again. -  - —Saint-14<br>'The name? Pigeons are the only birds left in the City sky. One of the many 'last things' we fight for. If you have a problem with that, we could step into the Crucible.' —Saint-14<br>

<br>Asher Mir's One-Way Ticket<br>Asher Mir loathes patrol duty. -  - Zavala thinks about respect, so Zavala thinks it's because of the recruits who swarmed Echo Mesa in the wake of the Red War. They jeer at Asher over the radio and meet his impatient condescension with brash challenges: Come say that to my face. But Zavala is wrong. -  - Cayde thinks about his free time, so Cayde thinks it's because Asher has better things to do. Why support a supply chain when you're dying of Vex flu? Sure, sure, it's not really flu; that's not the point. The guy's dying! But Cayde is wrong. -  - Ikora used to be wrong, too, but now Ikora thinks about death. She knows Asher has not died since he was transformed. She knows what it is to sit paralyzed beside a radio, full of jealous fear, listening to a battle that you cannot join. -  - They could bring him every jumpship in the system, she thinks, and he'd never leave the Rupture.<br>'It is possible to mathematically predict the cadence of death and resurrection in every firefight, regardless of combatant composition.' —Asher Mir<br>
<br>Ikora's Resolve<br>The Guardian gasps awake, like the breath was ripped out instead of restored. -  - The Ghost floats closer, not masking his agitation. 'You did it on purpose. Died. On purpose. I saw.' -  - The Guardian flips a hand impatiently. 'So what. Death is waiting for us every minute of every day. If I grab it by the throat, that's no different from me tripping over it in the dark before you bring me back.' -  - 'You know that the difference is intent. Guardians do not seek death. They embrace it as part of their sacrifice. They le—' -  - Singsong, now. ''They learn from it and they grow stronger.' Come on. I've learned more about being a 'Guardian' out here than from any of your Speaker's sermons under the Traveler. Whether or not a Knight slices my throat before I die.' -  - The Ghost looks hurt. 'Ikora, you don't—' -  - 'Later. We're going back to Trostland. I'm not going to grow any stronger sitting here pulling pine needles out of my face.' -  - She walks away, eyes brighter than her Ghost's in the dark. He floats in place, silent, and then follows.<br>'I'd tell my younger self, 'There will be plenty of time to settle down. For now, enjoy the ride.'' —Ikora Rey<br>
<br>The Sundaresh Experiment 13-R<br>Esi: Is that... radiolarian fluid?! - Sundaresh: Close the bulkhead, Chioma. - Esi: Where did you even— - Sundaresh: The excesses from Shim's siphons were just being discarded. This is better. - Esi: And you're using it as, what? A propellant? - Sundaresh: A coolant. If the Vex decide to simulate things in physical space such that we can experience them natively, we must understand more than just their physiology. We are too focused on the abstract and the theoretical and the simulated, love. We are scientists, yes, but humans also make tools. - Esi: That meditation sim really had an effect on you. - Sundaresh: Hush. - Esi: A ship built with repurposed Ishtar construction materials, integrating Vex technology almost as an afterthought. - Sundaresh: You disapprove. - Esi: The last time I questioned an idea like this, it ended up saving us from simulation purgatory. I would be a fool to disapprove. - Sundaresh: Then come here and let's celebrate.<br>Ishtar Collective research led to places unexpected, unexplored, and in some cases unsanctioned.<br>

<br>Garden Progeny 1<br>Excerpt from 'The Definitive History of Osiris,' by Brother Vance -  - In the wake of the Iron Lords' untimely deaths and the chaos that threatened to topple the fledging City from within, the one known as the Speaker made his bid for power. To create the illusion of democracy, the Speaker established the Consensus, an oligarchical body of representatives from the City's leading political factions and the three Guardian classes. For the Titans: Saint-14, the right hand of the Speaker. For the Hunters: Tallulah Fairwind, first in a long line of ever-changing representatives. And for the Warlocks, the already-legendary warrior who had studied with Felwinter and Nirwen themselves: Osiris.<br>Two siblings cleaved by time and space, reflections never found alone, - The ending of the eldritch race—a path long seen but never known.<br>
<br>Khepri's Horn<br>The Hunter leaned on the sill of the broken window, poking at the upended beetle lightly with the barrel of her gun, rocking it little by little until it got its footing and flipped itself. As it crawled away, the crouching Titan pushed himself up, grunting as he did. - 'I was worried you'd shoot it for a sec. The poor guy.' - 'Nah, I'd not do that to ya. You know what they say about Titans.' - 'What do they say about Titans?' - 'Uh, well, you know…' - He crossed his arms, and a faint sparkle like coals burning out shimmered across him. 'Tell me.' - She raised her hands in surrender. 'All right. It's a joke so don't knock me for this one. 'Titans are like beetles, impervious until they've been knocked on their back.' Erm, all in good taste, of course.' - The Titan cracked a smile and then began to laugh. 'I see why Hunters wear that beetle armor then!'<br>'I pushed the sun. I can push you, too.' —Inscription inside the helm<br>
<br>Sagira's Shell<br>'So that's it?' Sagira cried out, as Ikora began to walk away from her old mentor. 'You're just going to let the Vanguard kick him out? After everything Osiris has done for you? He taught you everything you know!' -  - Ikora pivoted sharply. 'No. Osiris merely taught me everything HE knows.' -  - 'Admit it, Ikora. Without Osiris, you would still be running training exercises with that loud brute, Shaxx.' -  - 'It would be in your best interest to stop talking now, Sagira. The Crucible was my home.' -  - 'You were wasting your talents! Osiris made you greater than what you were. And now he needs you for something truly important. Where's your loyalty? You owe him.' -  - 'This conversation is over,' Ikora said, and walked away. -  - 'You bet it is! We are outta here! You'll all be sorry, you ingrates.'<br>Loyalty does not mean obligation. Only justice is blind.<br>


<br>Kairos Function<br>The unenlightened wonder at my so-called “fixation” upon the Vex. They believe our gravest existential threat is the Hive, for those beings have made a pact with the Darkness itself via the medium of the Worm Gods (according to Toland, at least, and I see no reason to doubt him in this). -  - But Darkness is not merely absence of Light. Darkness is an entity unto itself. Put simply, Darkness is not Nothing. -  - But the Vex? The Vex seek neither Light nor Darkness. They seek Convergence, the reduction of all life to its simplest, most meaningless form. An entelechy of zeros and ones. -  - “Evil” is a word for sentimentalists and fools. But, in the ontology of the sentimental, the Vex are more deserving of the term than the Hive. -  - Given a choice between Darkness and Convergence, I would choose Darkness. It is a logical choice. -  - Yet for this they banish me.<br>'Some speculate that the radiolarian fluid is the last vestige of a biological life form that became the Vex.' —Sister Faora, 'Theories on the Vex'<br>

<br>Helm of Saint-14<br>//AUDIO UNAVAILABLE// - //MAINTENANCE FRAME TRANSCRIPT FOLLOWS// - SX: You know what they say about Titans. - C6: They're loud and abrasive? - SX: The good ones are all dead. - C6: You don't know that Saint is dead. - SX: The greatest Titan who ever lived just disappeared. Call it a hunch. - [A generator roars.] - C6: No one ever put down a Kell faster than he could. But man, he was a real weirdo. - SX: Eccentricity was his strength. - C6: Talking about the Speaker like you're related to him is eccentric. Claiming he's seen the future, that he fought Six Fronts fueled on the idea that some Guardian savior is coming? That's insane. - SX: Belief is a hell of a thing. - C6: Sure, yeah. One Guardian's going to fix everything. Kick Crota off the Moon. Make it look like us Vanguard know our head from our hindquarters. Hey, where are you going? - SX: One of the new recruits from Old Russia I've had my eye on—entering the Crucible for the first time. - C6: Hey, maybe they're the one. We'll call ‘em Crota's End.<br>'He walked out into the demon light. But at the end he was brighter.' —Paean to Saint-14<br>
<br>Gemini Jester<br>He quietly giggled as he stood blocking my exit, almost as if to taunt me. I start to push my way past but the blasted fool pulls hard on my ear, swiftly takes a step back, and presents his rump in a jesting dance. Not willing to get pulled into his game, I ignore his blatant attempts at a farce and continue forward. Abrupt shrills of frenzied laughter break out as I feel the full force of his boot on my backside. I cannot ignore his flagrant mockery. I reel around, take hold of his collar and clock him full force. Behind me, in the distance, I hear hysterical laughter. Confused, I whirl my head back to see a jaunty man skipping off. I look back at my hands to find them empty. That jester has taken me for a fool.<br>'I love making people laugh. And by 'people,' I mean me. Haha!' 'Haha! Me!'<br>
<br>Future Safe 10<br>A fragment from Osiris -  - —ot been easy to gather this foresight. Prophecies are tricky things: they change the future they foretell. When a seer shares their knowledge of a coming event—any event, whether good or ill—there will always be those who gather to prevent it. Say too little and your meaning is lost. Say too much and you have made the task of your enemies easier. You must say just enough so that the few who can listen will hear. -  - I have done all I can. The rest is up to you. You must trust in me. -  - You must trust in yourself. -  - —Osiris<br>See who's robed as if a god, who stands with pride above the rest! - Destroy this ancient nameless fraud! Destroy the one whose death was blessed!<br>
<br>Electronica Shell<br>What Do Guardians Do When They're Not Saving the Solar System? - by Ember Hadad, Senior Editor at the City Herald -  - When I started my research for this piece, I expected to find that Guardians, when not waging war against alien invaders with mysterious paracausal powers, were not too different from their fellow citizens of the Last City. -  - Readers, I was wrong. -  - Guardians dance a lot more than we do. -  - 'That's pretty much all they do, when I see them,' says Park Soo-Yin, a maintenance worker in the Guardian headquarters. 'Just dance. Sometimes in groups, sometimes all alone.' -  - 'Sometimes they kind of dance 'at' each other, if you know what I mean,' Vanguard technician Kweku Aglah confirms. 'I feel like I'm watching the nature channel.'<br>For Ghosts who love to groove.<br>
<br>Fast Lane Shell<br>'I need a new project.' -  - 'Disagree.' Marcus's Ghost floated over to where he sat with his head down on his workbench, and gently bumped his temple. 'I see three half-finished Sparrows in this room alone, and you still haven't done that thing Ikora asked you to do. You're plenty busy.' -  - Marcus tilted his head to glare at his Ghost. 'Didi. Be serious.' -  - 'I am.' -  - Marcus groaned. -  - 'Fine.' Didi floated over to the wall where Marcus's bright red Sparrow-racing jacket dangled from a hook. 'You know, I've always wanted one of these. For me.' -  - 'Really?' -  - 'Is that weird?' -  - 'No!' Marcus jumped to his feet. 'It's aces. Of course you need a racing shell. I'm going to make you the flashiest shell you've ever seen.' He grabbed his Ghost out of the air and kissed her shell. 'Thank you, Didi!' -  - 'You're the one—never mind.' Didi bumped her Guardian's forehead affectionately. 'You're welcome, Marcus.'<br>For Ghosts who like to drive fast and look good while doing it.<br>
<br>Fire Victorious Shell<br>Consensus Meeting 3267.56 - Z: 'Callisto Yin. Thank you for joining us today.' - CY: 'My pleasure, sir.' - Z: 'You singlehandedly carried the Fire Victorious from the City as it fell, ensuring that the flames first kindled by Wei Ning so many years ago would continue to burn. For that, we thank you.' - CY: 'Any of the Firebreak Order would have done as much.' - NM: 'The repairs to Firebreak Plaza are almost complete. I think we may have the relighting ceremony as soon as next week.' - CY: 'With all due respect, we have decided not to bring the Fire Victorious back to the City. Not in the same way.' - FWC: 'What do you mean?' - CY: 'One torch in one city is too small.' - IR: 'What do you propose instead?' - CY: 'Now each of our Ghosts bears embers of the Fire Victorious. Wei Ning's flames will go with us to each new battlefield.'<br>For Ghosts with fire inside of them.<br>
<br>Star Map Shell<br>Overheard at the Fu'an Institute Library: -  - 'Get over here and tell me this is what I think this is.' -  - 'It looks like Golden Age shipping records.' -  - 'Look at these quantities! It must be a colony ship!' -  - ''Must be'? Excuse me, you do remember you're supposed to be a scholar, right?' -  - 'Come on, we know they were sending out colony ships in the Golden Age.' -  - 'We know they sent off the Exodus Black, which was lost for centuries until what's-their-name found it on Nessus. And we know they tried to accelerate the launch of the Exodus Blue during the Collapse, but it crashed in the Cosmodrome.' -  - 'Think of how many other colors there are!' -  - 'Listen. You think I wouldn't love to know that humans made it to other solar systems? But we don't have the evidence.' -  - 'I'm gonna find it. A Golden Age map of other stars.' -  - 'Don't stop looking. Just, you know, cite your sources.'<br>For Ghosts who want to chart new skies.<br>
<br>Cosmos Shell<br>The old doubts came back when the Light went out. - But the iron in her bones, worn and rusted as it was, never buckled. - The Light was gone, but holding a sniper rifle still felt right. - She marched into the City beneath a refugee's hood, took up a roost in the building with the white rabbit, and killed 216 Cabal with 199 bullets. - She cried when the Traveler woke before her eyes. - At her hip a radio blinked to life. It had gone quiet when the Red Legion attacked. She answered it with trembling fingers. - “I know,” she said. “I can see it. I can feel it.” - “Even the stars are brighter now,” said the voice over the radio. “The whole cosmos is ablaze.” - She closed her eyes. “I can't wait to see it. I'm coming home. Efrideet out.”<br>For Ghosts who wonder at the majesty of the universe.<br>

<br>Shinobu's Vow<br>I don't know how to write this. -  - I died. -  - Well, Shinobu died. -  - This is hard. -  - But she—I?—she must have kept this journal for a reason. So here goes. -  - One of the Hunters, Nadiya, told me most Guardians were dead for centuries before Ghosts find them, when all traces of their first lives are long gone. 'Nadiya' is a name she chose for herself. -  - 'Shinobu isn't your name anymore,' Nadiya said. -  - 'It could be,' I said. -  - Then Nadiya said, 'Shinobu and I were going to skip town.' She told me I—Shinobu—had realized there was no stopping the Fallen. That her village, Coyote, was doomed. -  - 'She wanted to leave this place,' Nadiya said. 'She didn't want to die here.' -  - So much for that. -  - —Excerpt from the diary of Himura Shinobu<br>'No supplies. Armor in tatters. But the refugees had asked for help. And she had given her word.' —Tale of the Six Coyotes<br>
<br>Vesper of Radius<br>Ikora Rey's personal library has no door. That's not a problem for the Hidden. -  - One moment, Ikora is alone at her desk, head bowed over a dusty tome. The next, Chalco Yong stands behind her. -  - 'I wondered what you were up to,' says Chalco. -  - 'Really?' Ikora doesn't turn. 'I always know what you're up to.' -  - 'I surprised you. Admit it.' -  - 'I promised I'd never lie to you, Chalco.' -  - The Hunter heaves a sigh and drapes an arm over Ikora's shoulder to read from her tome. -  - 'This is why you're taking less field work? Because you're reading 'On Circles, Volume 12'?' -  - 'I wrote it.' -  - 'Unsurprising.' -  - 'I have to rewrite it. All twelve volumes.' -  - 'Dare I ask why?' -  - 'The Traveler is alive!' -  - 'I've heard,' Chalco shrugs. 'So?' -  - 'So, our physics framework was completely wrong!' -  - 'Even about, like, circles?' -  - Ikora turns to look Chalco in the eye. 'Especially about circles.'<br>'Drawn like so, the Rift circle reinscribes planetary energy as a destructive force.' —Ikora Rey, 'On Circles, Volume 12'<br>
<br>Mk. 44 Stand-Asides<br>The tree in the Garden with silver wings. The air around it is oppressive and inspires violence in those who even breathe a little in. Shards of the disastrous bark peel from it and litter the ground, and nothing grows in its shadow. It scintillates faintly at dusk. It has achieved its entelechy with every body falling, every civilization laid to waste, every leaf forged into instruments of ruin. - The Gardener is hard to bother; she is constantly amidst her weeds, kneeling in the tangent dust, gloves covered in a mix of distant soils and metallic saps. She is listening to the music of the insects amidst the flowers, the unguent as it begins to drip from the ferns, the slight scratch of the Worm beneath, and not to you, and certainly not to your cries for help.<br>Pardon me.

<br>Traveler's Judgment 5<br>How to interpret the Lost Prophecies? The theory in vogue right now with the Followers of Osiris is that the first five verses refer to the Black Garden, the coming of Ghaul, the Traveler's awakening and Ghaul's subsequent defeat. It's a convincing interpretation, even conceding that prophecies are much easier to interpret in hindsight. - There's just one thing: if Osiris used the Infinite Forest to develop his prophecies, and the Infinite Forest cannot accurately simulate Light, how did Osiris predict the Traveler would wake? The forest's very inability to predict this very thing is what prevented Panoptes from breaking ground with its apocalyptic calculations. - I must assume: 1) Either verse 5 does not refer to the Traveler's awakening, or 2) Osiris has prophetic resources at his disposal other than the Forest. What they are I have no idea.<br>A visitor ignites the sky, and in the truth of light it dreams: - Above the dead and yet-to-die, a legion's blade with fire screams.<br>
